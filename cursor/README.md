# Cursor Agent Guide

Use this repo's AI guides to keep edits small, safe, and reversible.

## Read first

- `../AI.md` — repo-wide agent rules and safety checklist.
- `../WARP.md` — terminal and operational commands.
- `../agents/` — playbooks for Neovim, Zsh, and Brew/Stow.

## Editing principles

- Make narrowly-scoped edits per file.
- Preserve indentation and formatting; avoid noise-only diffs.
- Prefer configuration over custom code where possible.
- Explain what changed at a high level in PR descriptions/commit messages.
